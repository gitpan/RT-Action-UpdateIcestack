  Configure Icestack Integration
    Icestack communicates with RT via an RT User. It is necessary to
    populate the IcestackCode and IcestackHostURL fields for this User so
    that the update mechanism will function.

    This User should have access to one or more queues. These will be
    visible to the Icestack system.

    The instructions given below are for creation of new User and Queue(s).
    It is also possible to modify an existing User.

   Create User
    As alluded to above this User will be associated with a particular
    Icestack instance via the custom fields.

        Log onto RT web interface as root
        Click Tools->Configuration->Users->Create
            Username: <user name>
            Let this user access RT: CHECK
            Let this user be granted rights (Privileged): CHECK
            IcestackHostURL: <url>
            IcestackCode: <code>
        Click Create

   Create Queue and assign rights for User
    Create one or more Queues to be associated with the User and Icestack
    instance.

        Log onto RT web interface as root
        Click Tools->Configuration->Queues->Create
            Queue Name: <queue name>
            Description: Queue for <user name>
            Lifecycle: default
        Click Create
        Click Tools->Configuration->Queues->Select
        Click <queue name>
        Click User Rights
        Add rights for this user: <user name>
            Create tickets: CHECK

            Modify tickets: CHECK
            (others may be necessary, depending...)
